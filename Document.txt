Algoritham
-------------------------------
* Set of rules.
* Any language can implement.
* To store and processthe data.
* Information must be stored in structure form.


Linear Datastructure Examples:
-------------------------------
* Array --> Elements stored in sequence way.
* Stack --> Last-In and first-out.
* Queue --> Fist-in and First-out.
* Linked List --> Stored elements in the form of nodes.

Object
------------------------------
It is a real world entity consists of
* Identity --> It is unique and used to access the object.
* Variable --> To store Information of object.
* Function --> To process the Information.

Tokenizing/Lexing
-------------------------------
Breaking up a string of characters into meaningful (to the language) chunks, called tokens. For instance, 
consider the program var a = 2;. This program would likely be broken up into the following tokens: var,
a, =, 2, and ;. Whitespace may or may not be persisted as a token, depending on whether its meaningful
or not.
